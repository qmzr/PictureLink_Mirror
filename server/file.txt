I want you to take this JSON and populate it with appropriate values. I will provide you with that json and the policy you should follow for populating the values. Here is the JSON:

{
    "top_10_classes":[ {"class_name" : "", class_number : 0, score: 0,logit: 0 }],
    "top_10_prototypes": [ { "coordinates: [] } ]
}

Here is the policy for populating the value for the key "top_10_classes":
1. The array associated with key "top_10_classes" should contain 10 elements.
2. Each elements of the array should be a json that is of the form: {"class_name" : "", class_number : 0, score: 0,logit: 0}
3. Choose a random bird name and it's corresponding class number from the CUB-200-2011 dataset.
4. Set the value of the key "class_name" and "class_number" to the chosen bird name and it's corresponding class name, respectively
5. Set the value of the key "score" to a random number from 0 to 100
6. Set the value of the key "logit" to a random number from -100 to 1000
7. Set the value of the key "probability" to a random decimal number from 0.00 to 1.00. 
8. Lastly make sure that all the values associated with the key "probability" sums up to 1.

Here is the policy for populating the value for the key "top_10_prototypes":
1. The array associated with key "top_10_prototypes" should contain 1 elements.
2. Each element of the array should be a json that is of the form: { "coordinates": [] }
3. Set the value of the key "coordinates" to a list of 10 elements. Let each element of the list be a list of 4 random numbers from 0 to 10 each.

"top_10_prototypes": [{ "image_address_name": "", pairs: { "coordinates: [],"address : [] } }]


{
    "top_10_classes":[ {"class_name" : "", class_number : 0, score: 0,logit: 0 }],
    "top_10_prototypes": [ { "coordinates: [],"address : [] } ]
}

{
    "top_10_classes":[ {"class_name" : "", class_number : 0, score: 0,logit: 0 , prototype_image_address: [] , original_image_address:[]}],
    "top_10_prototypes": [ { "coordinates: [],"address : [] } ]
}


7. Set the value of the key "prototype_image_address" to a list of 10 elements. Let each element of the list be a string of the form 'top-X_activated_prototype_in_original_pimg.png', where X is index of the string in the list
8. Set the value of the key "prototype_image_address" to a list of 10 elements. Let each element of the list be a string of the form 'most_highly_activated_patch_in_original_img_by_top-X_prototype.png', where X is index of the string in the list
